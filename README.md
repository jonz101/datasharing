How to share data with a statisticians
===========

###This is a guide for anyone who needs to share data with a statistician. The target audiences I have in mind are:

* Scientific collaborators who need statisticians to analyze data for them
* Students or postdocs in scientific disciplines looking for consulting advice
* Junior statistics students whose job it is to collate/clean data sets

What you should deliver to the statistician
====================

###For maximum speed in the analysis this is the information you should pass to a statistician:

## The raw data

 
 look something like:

1. Step 1 - take the raw file, run version 3.1.2 of summarize software with parameters a=1, b=2, c=3
1. Step 2 - run the software separately for each sample
1. Step 3 - take column three of outputfile.out for each sample and that is the corresponding row in the output data set
